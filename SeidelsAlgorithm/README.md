# Homework for HSE Course "Computation Complexity": 
## Seidel's Algorithm
This homework was done by Sergey Babikov. 
## About program
This program implements Seidel's APSP algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seidel%27s_algorithm).
## How to use: 
1) Build project and run;
2) Enter any number of nodes (vertices) to generate random undirected, unweighted and connected graph;
3) Look at your console! There you can find information about generated graph and solution to APSP problem created by Seidel's Algorithm!
## Project structure:
- "Structures" folder:
	- SquaredMatrix.cs - structure of a squared matrix;
- "GraphClasses" folder:
	- Edge.cs - class for an edge of a graph;
	- Node.cs - class for graph nodes;
	- Graph.cs - class for graph;
- Algorithm.cs - Seidel's algorithm implementation;
- Program.cs - entry point.
