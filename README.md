# Homework for HSE Course "Computation Complexity": 
## Seidel's Algorithm
This homework was done by Sergey Babikov. 
## About program
This program implements Seidel's APSP algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seidel%27s_algorithm).
## How to use: 
1) Open .sln file via Visual Studio 2019 from "SeidelsAlgorithm" project folder;
2) Build "SeidelsAlgorithm" project and run;
3) Enter any number of nodes (vertices) to generate random undirected, unweighted and connected graph;
4) Look at your console! There you can find information about generated graph and solution to APSP problem created by Seidel's Algorithm!
## Repository structure:
- "SeidelsAlgorithm" - main project folder
- "XUnitTestProject" - xUnit test project folder
1) Build project and run;
2) Enter any number of nodes (vertices) to generate random undirected, unweighted and connected graph;
3) Look at your console! There you can find information about generated graph and solution to APSP problem created by Seidel's Algorithm!
